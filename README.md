I am a [_chargé de recherche_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_ranks_in_France#Research-only_positions) at [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en/cnrs), interested in cryptography for anonymity and authentication.

Previously, I was a scholar at [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/). I got my PhD from the [École](https://ens.fr).
