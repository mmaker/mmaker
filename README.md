 👋 Hi, I’m Michele Orrù ([@mmaker](https://twitter.com/mmaker))

 🏛️ I am a [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en/cnrs) [_research scientist_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_ranks_in_France#Research-only_positions).

 🥷🏻 I’m interested in cryptography for anonymity and authentication

🎨 Previously, I was a research scholar at [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/). I got my PhD from the [École](https://ens.fr) with [Georg Fuchsbauer](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fuchsbau/)
